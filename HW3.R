#Density Plot: 
Each facet represents the density distribution of RECVDVACC for a specific education level (EEDUC). 
Each facet will show a smoothed curve representing the distribution of RECVDVACC for the corresponding education level.

#By examining the different facets (plots for each education level), we can see how the distribution of vaccination status varies with education level. 
#We observe that individuals with some college diplomas, associate degrees, and bachelorâ€™s degrees have higher densities for the vaccination status labeled as "Yes, got vaccine."
#There are also more "N/A" entries for individuals with high school diplomas and some college degrees.
#This may be because some individuals did not provide their vaccination status or because some participants chose not to answer the vaccination status question.
